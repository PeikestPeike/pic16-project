# Project Name:
MarkovText.v2

# Group Members:
Peike Li, Yuxuan Shi, Johnny Tu

# Project Description:
MarkovText.v2 is a simplified Markov Language Model. It models a text corpus and generates a fake text from it, using units of words. To compare two texts, it can compute the [Flesch reading ease score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests) for the two texts.

# Instructions on Package Installments:
conda create --name NEWENV --file requirements.txt

# Description of Demo File:
//This includes detailed instructions on how to run it, what output one should expect to see, and any explanations or interpretations of the result. There should be at least 2 figures embedded in this section. It can be screenshots of your game, or plots generated by your data visualization code. Make sure these figures have appropriate titles and captions, and are sufficiently explained in your text.

1. After you download the repo, you'll find the demo file called demo.ipynb. Open it to test the functionalities of the class MarkovText.
2. Run the first cell to import the class and all the functions. Run the second cell to load the Emma text file into the environment.
3. Run the cell shown below to test what happens if the function cannot generate appropriate text with the original input seed and n. The function will automatically try n-1 and call itself again to generate the fake text. The expected output in this case should be the random text that is successfully generated.

4. Run the cell shown below to create an object of the class MarkovText. n represents n-gram, length represents the expected number of words of the text generated, and seed represents the starting word of the fake text. You can change the length to another number, but don't make it too large for your convenience.

5. Run the cell shown below to call the function that generates fake text. The expected output should be a string with about <length> words.

6. Run the cell shown below to call the function that generates exactly one sentence. The expected output should be a string with only one sentence.

7. Run the cell shown below to call the function that computes and prints the Flesch reading ease score for the fake text and the original text with the same length. This reading score represents the readablity of the text. The higher the score is, the easier it is to read the text. The scores would change each time you run this cell, because our model generates different random text and select the original text randomly each time.
